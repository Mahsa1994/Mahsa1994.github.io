excerpt: "I am Mahsa Hasheminejad, an engineer with a strong focus on artificial intelligence, specifically in the field of computer vision. I obtained my BSc in computer science from the Amirkabir University of Technology.
From 2017 to 2019, I had the opportunity to work as an ML engineer at Sensifai, a leading company in the field. During my time there, I was developing cutting-edge deep learning models for recognition purposes. I also worked on creating an identification system using face recognition methods to efficiently locate actors within digital archives.
In 2019, I joined the team at Nojan Robotics and AI as an AI engineer, and I continue to contribute to their exciting projects to this day. At Nojan, I have been involved in developing intelligent machines capable of sorting various types of nuts and fruits. Additionally, I have actively contributed to the sorter machines platform, utilizing C++ and Qt, while implementing user interfaces for the sorting machines using Figma and QML.
I am deeply committed to exploring and pushing the boundaries of computer vision technologies, aiming to create innovative solutions that make a positive impact in various industries."
